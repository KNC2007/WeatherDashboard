# WeatherDashboard
5 Day Weather Forecast retrieves weather data for cities.

## Description
The weather dashboard uses the Open Weather API to display the Current Weather and 5 day forecast for a selected city. The user types in a city name into the input field and clicks Search. The city name, the dates, icons representating the weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed are displayed for the current day and the next five days. The city is then saved in a history list. The user can click back on their old searches and display the city's weather conditions again.
